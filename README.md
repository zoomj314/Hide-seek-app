Playing hide and seek is fun, but there are some anoyances inherint in the game. For one thing, the finder has to wait a set amount of time regardless of if the hider has hidden yet. Why waste 30 seconds waiting if the hider has already hidden? Additionally, a hider who is not found within the alotted time for the game way not wish to reveal their hiding spot by immediately coming out. Finally, wouldn't it be funny if the hider's phone suddenly started playing a foghorn sound at full volume in the middle of the game?

All of these issues are addressed by this app. You connect two phones on the same network together, then you can set the parameters of the game (time for hiding and finding), then press start. Both phones show the countdown for hiding. Once the hider is hidden, they have a button they can press to notify the finder that they are ready early. Once the time is up, the finder's app will alert them and they will go back to the starting position and press a button to notify the hider that it is safe to come out. And if the hider gets bored and starts spamming the "ping" button, their phone will suddenly play a foghorn sound at full volume!
